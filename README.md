First picture is main page of application. Check buttons are clickable, if we click one we can select and click twice we can unselect the checkbox

When we clicked the plus button on the rigth upper corner, we see the task addition page. Task must have a title and other details. After clicked the save, we directly go to the main page and see the new task.

If we want to delete the task we can slide the left.

Even if we close the app we still can see our informations thanks to core data.
